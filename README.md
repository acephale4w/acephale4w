- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @acephale4w
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... OSINT, Python, Threat Hunting, Pentesting, and Red Teaming  - not necessarily in that other
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... OSINT, Scripting, Pentesting basics, and DFIR
- I participate in OSINT CTF's regularly ... I have 3 of them under my belt, and many more to come (hopefully). I've done two CTF's with Trace Labs, and one with the ATII (Darkwebathon)
- I LOVE Classic Literature, Philosophy & Poetry, but also SF novels - Rilke, Borges, Bataille, Camus, Faulkner, Hoelderlin, Heraclitus, Nietszche, Asimov, Vonnegut, are just some of the legends who had a profound influence on my being and thought
- I also try really hard.
