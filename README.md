- Hi, I’m @acephale4w...
- I’m interested in... OSINT, Python, SecOps, Threat Hunting, Pentesting, and Red Teaming  - not necessarily in that order!
- I’m currently learning... OSINT, Scripting, Pentesting basics, and DFIR.
- I participate in OSINT CTF's regularly... I have 4 of them under my belt, and, hopefully, many more to come! I've done two CTF's with Trace Labs, and two with the ATII (Darkwebathon) - where I've used their proprietary tool: Project Hades.
- Feel free to check out my Infosec posts at https://vicarius.io/vsociety/users/acephale?type=blog-posts

Some cool and, maybe, relevant links, and other stuff:
