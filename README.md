- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @acephale4w... this is my TryHackMe profile - https://tryhackme.com/p/nk4w
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in... OSINT, Python, Threat Hunting, Pentesting, and Red Teaming  - not necessarily in that order!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning... OSINT, Scripting, Pentesting basics, and DFIR.
- I participate in OSINT CTF's regularly... I have 3 of them under my belt, and, hopefully, many more to come. I've done two CTF's with Trace Labs, and one with the ATII (Darkwebathon) - where I've used their proprietary tool: Project Hades.
- I LOVE Classic Literature, Philosophy & Poetry, but also SF novels - Rilke, Borges, Bataille, Camus, Faulkner, Hoelderlin, Heraclitus, Nietszche, Asimov, Vonnegut, those are some of the legends who had a profound influence on my being and thought.
- My favorite movie of all time is Clockwork Orange.
- I want to achieve both depth, and width, when it comes to knowledge - that is my (un)fortunate nature - which I've eventually embraced and stopped trying to escape.
- In part, that's also why I try really hard.
- Fun trivia about me: I almost ended up playing professional basketball. Loved the game, but hated the idea of being a modern day gladiator e.g getting paid for my physical prowess, which is why I quit and never looked back. I have one published short story on Amazon Kindle.
